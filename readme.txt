With our Login | Register Link, your clients will be able to stay on your website to manage their accounts and see their schedule. 



== Description ==

**Now developers and non-developers alike can add a HealCode Link, specifically the Login | Register link, to the main navigation menu!** 

This plugin lets you add a Login | Register link to the right-most end of your navigation menu. This Link (also called the My Account link) will pull up the HealCode Consumer Cart, which allows your clients to login to their MINDBODY accounts from your website and to create new MINDBODY accounts from your website.

HealCode syncs with your MINDBODY account and can display MINDBODY information including classes, enrollments, appointments, staff biographies, class/enrollment descriptions, and more. See our other WordPress plugin, [HealCode MINDBODY Widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/healcode-mindbody-widget/ "HealCode MINDBODY Widget").

*Keep in mind that if you want to add Widgets or Buy Now links to a Pricing page, you will need to either use our other plugin, [HealCode MINDBODY Widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/healcode-mindbody-widget/), or the traditional installation method [here](https://healcode.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203040594-Configuring-a-Service-Link-e-g-a-Buy-Now-link-or-My-Account-link-for-deployment).*

**NOTE** You will need a HealCode account to use this plugin. Visit [HealCode](http://www.healcode.com/ "HealCode") to sign up! If you are a developer, you can learn more about our Developer Partner program [here](http://www.healcode.com/developer-signup/).

HealCode Links are links you put on your website to provide the following, specific functions:

The **Login | Register link** provides a client the ability to log in and see their account information. Once in the My Account area, they can view their contact info, update their credit card, view their schedule, view their purchase history or view their account balances. When the Login | Register Link is first clicked, it brings up the login screen of the HealCode Consumer Cart.

The **My Cart link** provides a client the ability to view their cart and any items that are in it. See: [HealCode MINDBODY Widget](https://healcode.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202867484--What-are-Service-Links-i-e-Buy-Now-links-My-Account-links-and-Cart-links-)

A **Buy Now link** provides a client the ability to purchase a "Pricing Option" (as that term is used in MINDBODY) directly from your website.

See our [HealCode MINDBODY Link Plugin FAQ](https://healcode.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203681304)

At this time, the HealCode MINDBODY Link plugin can only add one HealCode Link to the end of the main menu.

= I have two menus (or more) and the Link is appearing in all of them. What should I do ? =

[Contact HealCode support](http://www.healcode.com/tech_support/) so that we can provide you with instructions for removing the extra link. If you are comfortable with CSS, you can use CSS to hide the extra link(s).

You can find the code for each Link in each in the HealCode Manager. You can login [here](https://manager.healcode.com/users/sign_in "here"). 

= HealCode MINDOBDY Link is not working properly. =

Please check the WordPress version you are using. Make sure it meets the minimum version recommended by us. Make sure all files of the `healcode_mindbody_link` plugin are uploaded to the folder `wp-content/plugins/`

= I have another plugin installed for my navigation menu, and HealCode MINDBODY Link isnâ€™t working now . =

Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that our plugin will work with other plugins, especially plugins that are made specifically for the navigation menu.
