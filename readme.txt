With our Login | Register, Buy Now, or Cart links, your clients will be able to stay on your website to make purchases and manage their accounts. 



== Description ==

**Now developers and non-developers alike can add a HealCode Link, including a Login | Register link, to the main navigation menu!** 

This plugin lets you add either a Login | Register link, Cart link, or a Buy Now link to the right-most end of your navigation menu. These links will pull up the HealCode Consumer Cart, which allows your clients to purchase pricing options from your MINDBODY account, login to their MINDBODY accounts from your website, and to create new MINDBODY accounts from your website.

HealCode syncs with your MINDBODY account and can display MINDBODY information including classes, enrollments, appointments, staff biographies, class/enrollment descriptions, and more. See our other WordPress plugin, [HealCode MINDBODY Widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/healcode-mindbody-widget/ "HealCode MINDBODY Widget").

*Keep in mind that if you want to add Buy Now links to a Pricing page, you will need to either use our other plugin, [HealCode MINDBODY Widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/healcode-mindbody-widget/), or the traditional installation method [here](https://healcode.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203040594-Configuring-a-Service-Link-e-g-a-Buy-Now-link-or-My-Account-link-for-deployment).*

**NOTE** You will need a HealCode account to use this plugin. Visit [HealCode](http://www.healcode.com/ "HealCode") to sign up! If you are a developer, you can learn more about our Developer Partner program [here](http://www.healcode.com/developer-signup/).

HealCode Links are links you put on your website to provide the following, specific functions:

The **Login | Register link** provides a client the ability to log in and see their account information. Once in the My Account area, they can view their contact info, update their credit card, view their schedule, view their purchase history or view their account balances. When the Login | Register Link is first clicked, it brings up the login screen of the HealCode Consumer Cart.

The **My Cart link** provides a client the ability to view their cart and any items that are in it.

A **Buy Now link** provides a client the ability to purchase a "Pricing Option" (as that term is used in MINDBODY) directly from your website.
