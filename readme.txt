Add a HealCode Service Link to your main navigation menu.



== Description ==

**Now you can add a HealCode Service Link, including a "Login" link, to your main navigation menu!** 

This plugin lets you add either a "My Account" link, "My Cart" link, or a "Buy Now" link to the end of your navigation menu. These links will pull up the HealCode Consumer Cart, which allows your clients to purchase pricing options from your MINDBODY account, login to their MINDBODY accounts from your website, and to create new MINDBODY accounts from your website.

HealCode syncs with your MINDBODY account and can display MINDBODY information including classes, enrollments, appointments, staff biographies, class/enrollment descriptions, and more. See our other WordPress plugin, [HealCode MINDBODY Widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/healcode-mindbody-widget/ "HealCode MINDBODY Widget").

**NOTE** you will need a HealCode account to use this plugin. Visit [HealCode](http://www.healcode.com/ "HealCode") to sign up!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are HealCode Service Links? What is a “My Account” Link? =

Service Links are links you put on your website to provide the following, specific functions:

The My Account link provides a client the ability to login and see their account information. Once in the My Account area, they can view their contact info, update their credit card, view their schedule, view their purchase history or view their account balances. When the My Account link is first clicked, it brings up the login screen of the HealCode Consumer Cart.

The Cart link provides a client the ability to view their cart and any items that are in it.

The Buy Now link provides a client the ability to purchase a "Pricing Option" (as that term is used in MINDBODY) directly from your website. Learn about what Pricing Options are supported [here](https://healcode.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202985440--What-is-the-Consumer-Cart-and-known-issues-for-it "here").
